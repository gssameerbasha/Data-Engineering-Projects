The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency
responsible for licensing and regulating New York City&#39;s Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-
hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans,
and paratransit vehicles. Over 200,000 TLC licensees complete approximately 1,000,000
trips each day. To operate for hire, drivers must first undergo a background check, have a
safe driving record, and complete 24
hours of driver training. TLC-licensed vehicles are inspected for safety and emissions at
TLC&#39;s Woodside Inspection Facility. It is a priority of the New York City Taxi and Limousine
Commission to provide safe, reliable transportation options for all New Yorkers and to
recognize and address the needs of our licensees. TLC supports and contributes to city-wide
efforts of traffic safety, accessibility and technological improvements. Policy researchers at
the TLC use data generated by licensees to observe changing trends in the industry and
inform decisions made by agency and the City.
